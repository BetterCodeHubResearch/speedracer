Speed Racer is a perf runner, like a test runner, but for performance :racing_car:. It executes scripts (*runs*) in Chrome (headlessly if possible) and produces reports on JavaScript execution, rendering and fps (more to come).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g speedracer
```

Speed Racer needs Chrome to profile your files.
Preferably, if you have Chrome Canary installed it will run it headlessly.


## Usage

```sh
$ speedracer -h

  üèé Speed Racer v0.1.0

  speedracer files [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help            Usage information  false
    -t, --traces          Save traces        false
    -r, --reports         Save reports       false
    -o dir, --output=dir  Output directory   ./.speedracer
    -d, --duration        Run duration (ms)  5000

  Examples:

  ‚Äì Race files in perf directory:

    $ speedracer

  ‚Äì Race files matching perf/**/*.js glob:

    $ speedracer perf/**/*.js

  ‚Äì Save traces and reports:

    $ speedracer --reports --traces --output=./speedracer
```

## Runs

Speed Racer serves all the scripts you specified, loads them into Chrome and traces them. It's done sequentially for now.

### Duration

By default a run last 5 seconds maximum. This can be changed with the `--duration` flag.
Sometimes you may want it to stop earlier. You can stop a run by calling `speedracer.end()` directly from a script.

*More control on run duration is coming*.

### Scripts

As they are run using Chrome you have access to native DOM and lots of ES6 goodness without any transpilation. If you want more details on what is available out-of-the-box here is a [list](https://www.chromestatus.com/features).

The only limitation for now is that you can't require any other script via `commonjs` (*but it's coming very soon!*). You can browse examples [here](https://github.com/ngryman/speedracer/tree/master/test/fixtures).


## Reports

Reports are `json` files that contain a performance summary of your run. They give you insights of what is taking time and why. 

They can be useful to track performance regressions. You can save those reports and compare them with new ones before commiting changes. You will then know if the new changes affected performance in a some way.

Here is the format:

## Traces

Speed Racer can also save traces of your runs. Traces contains events emitted by Chrome when your scripts are executed. Those events gives a bunch of informations about the overall performance of your scripts. Here is the detail [format](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CvAClvFfyA5R-PhYUmn5OOQtYMH4h6I0nSsKchNAySU/preview#heading=h.uxpopqvbjezh).

You can analyze them the way you want or simply load them in the Timeline/Performance tab of Chrome.
Traces can be pretty big, so they are saved `gzip`.

### Load in Devtools

First you need to locate and decompress your trace.

```sh
$ cd .speedracer
$ ls
high-cup.trace.gz
$ gunzip high-cup.trace
```

Then you load it in Chrome Devtools and enjoy :tada:!
